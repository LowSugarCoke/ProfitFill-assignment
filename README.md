# Job Management Dashboard

This project develops a job management system using a web application that enables efficient management of job records through interactive features. The system leverages a robust backend API and a dynamic frontend interface.

## Features

- **Backend API**: Provides robust endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting job records.
- **Frontend Application**: Offers a user-friendly interface for interacting with the API, which includes viewing job lists, detailed job information, and forms for job manipulation.
